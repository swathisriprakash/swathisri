    Sri Lankan cricketer Matheesha Pathirana sets world speed record with 175kmph delivery<br>
    Matheesha Pathirana is a Sri Lankan cricketer who was born in Kandy, Sri Lanka on December 18, 2002. He is a right-hand bat and a right-arm fast bowler. He made his international debut in 2023 and has played for various teams, including Sri Lanka U19, Chennai Super Kings, and Kandy Warriors. He has been referred to as “Baby Malinga” due to his bowling action being modeled after Lasith Malinga. Maheesh Theekshana, another Sri Lankan cricketer, played 9 IPL matches and scored 7 runs in 2 innings.<br>
    A bowler with a slingy action, Matheesha Pathirana made his international debut for Sri Lanka in August 2022 during the Asia Cup against Afghanistan. It wasn't a debut to remember though as Sri Lanka were beaten by Afghanistan in that game by 8 wickets. Pathirana conceded 16 runs in the only over he bowled in the 20-20 contest. His ODI debut came against the same oppositon 10 months later, and once again Pathirana couldn't chip in with a substantial contribution as he managed to pick only 1 wicket in the 50-50 over contest. Sri Lanka ended on the losing side once again as Afghanistan won the match by 6 wickets. Pathirana's start to his international career wouldn't be a pleasant one, however, the pace bowler had an impressive season for the Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2023 where he picked 10 wickets in the tournament and played a pivotal role in CSK's successful campaign. As a result of Pathirana's crucial spells, CSK managed to win a few games. An impactful bowler in the shortest bowler, but it will be interesting to see if he manages to be equally impactful in the ODI format.<br>
