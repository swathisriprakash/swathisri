<h1>IPL through the years</h1>

Jadeja's rise does have a lot to do with Dhoni's undying support but it was actually the IPL that found the Saurashtra boy - or rather the legendary Shane Warne to be precise. As captain of the Rajasthan Royals, the Australian spotted Jadeja's prowess and had said back in 2008-09 that this 'Rockstar' would go places. He wasn't wrong at all. After featuring for Rajasthan briefly, Jadeja became an integral part of the Chennai outfit till the squad was briefly suspended after the 2015 season. During the side's two-year hiatus, its players were scattered across and Jadeja found himself with his native Gujarat franchise - a temporary side. With the Chennai squad returning from the 2018 season onwards, he was among the three people retained - proof enough of how much he is valued there.

After an outstanding 2021 IPL where he scored 227 runs and took 13 wickets, Jadeja was hot property ahead of the 2022 mega auction. CSK splurged INR 16 crore to acquire his services and made him captain. But after just 2 wins in their first 8 games, Jadeja handed back the captaincy to MS Dhoni to concentrate on his own game. He was subsequently ruled out of the season due to a rib injury. After reports of a rift between the franchise and Jadeja, the allrounder was reportedly spoken to and returned for the 2023 season.
